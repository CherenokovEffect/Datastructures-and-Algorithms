Binary search works iff:

Array is sorted

Predicate is monotonic (false → true OR true → false)

A function / condition is monotonic if it changes in only one direction.

That means:

Once it becomes true, it never becomes false again
OR

Once it becomes false, it never becomes true again

No zig-zag.
